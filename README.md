# gnapp - A webapp/service for GermaNet

gnapp is a small web-application to explore [GermaNet](www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/GermaNet/) as well as a web-service exposing GermaNet through HTTP.
gnapp uses [pygermanet](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygermanet/) which itself requires [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/de).
